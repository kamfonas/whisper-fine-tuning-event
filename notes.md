## Thread about Whisper Greek Fine-tuning

### sanchit-gandhi 12/06/2022 10:38 AM
Wow great work! You've boosted the WER performance by nearly 10% compared to the original checkpoint, that's fantastic!

![Comparative Performande:](assets/comparative_performance_el.png)

You can see that for CV9 the small checkpoint from the Whisper paper gets 31% WER. We're now at 20% WER!
Is there a file called "README.md" that's in your local directory that wasn't pushed to Hub? If so, could you copy and paste it here? We can add it to your model so that it gets tracked on the leaderboard 🙂
Right here's what I suggest! We can try two things:
1) We combine the Greek splits of CV11 and FLEURS to give a larger training set. This will prevent overfitting and help your model get even better performance!

2) We have a go fine-tuning the 'medium' checkpoint! The medium checkpoint works nearly 10% better than small out of the box. If we fine-tune the medium checkpoint, we'll no doubt smash the 20% WER you got with small

I personally think we should try 2 first and see how good we can go with just the CV11 training data!


### sanchit-gandhi — 12/06/2022 11:02 AM
Awesome @MilesT! Maybe you can share with @farsipal what sort of batch sizes and learning rates worked well, and if the model started to overfit? It might be that we need to do 1 and 2 at the same time to get decent performance with the medium checkpoint (CV11 & FLEURS)

### MilesT — 12/06/2022 11:04 AM
Yes, while the WER went lower, it did start to overfit

### sanchit-gandhi — 12/06/2022 11:11 AM
Okay should we try combining the CV11 and FLEURS datasets together? I added a section to the README yesterday on how you can do this! https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event#mixing-datasets-optional
We can also try setting some regularisation:

```
model.config.dropout = 0.1
```

Let's not go too high though either 0.05 or 0.1. The model was not pre-trained with regularisation so the activations go a bit crazy if you go too high 😅
It didn't work for me going higher than 0.1 for English or Hindi (results got worse)

### MilesT — 12/06/2022 11:32 AM

ok 🙂

### Transformer — 12/06/2022 2:06 PM
Hi @sanchit-gandhi , can we combine all the splits while in streaming mode? e.g do something like 

load_dataset("google/fleurs", "el_gr", split="train+validation", use_auth_token=access_token, streaming=True)

### farsipal — 12/06/2022 3:15 PM
Hi @MilesT 
My progress bar is not working so I have no it/sec to give you, but  the 5000 steps of greek subset transcription training took somewhere between 16-18 hours. I am doing batch=16 accumulate=4

If I am doing this right the equivalent with A100 based on the 0.14 number is 1÷0.14×5000=9.9 but I don't think that includes validation time. I think the laptop 3080 is about 15-30% slower than the equivalent server 3080. I am not sure how the A100 relates to the 3080 though. 

### farsipal — 12/06/2022 3:25 PM
This function combines splits of one dataset. We want to combine splits from fleurs and common-voice into one interleaved set.  I assume that when we straddle datasets column names and various formatting conventions may be different. The new script provided by @sanchit-gandhi  seems to address these discrepancies.

### Transformer — 12/06/2022 4:40 PM
Did you manage to interleave common_voice and fleurs datasets? I get this error when trying to do that: 

```
ValueError: The features can't be aligned because the key audio of features {'audio': {'array': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float64', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'path': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'sampling_rate': Value(dtype='int64', id=None)}, 'sentence': Value(dtype='string', id=None)} has unexpected type - {'array': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float64', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'path': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'sampling_rate': Value(dtype='int64', id=None)} (expected either {'array': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float32', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'path': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'sampling_rate': Value(dtype='int64', id=None)} or Value("null").
```

### MilesT — 12/06/2022 5:08 PM
I think on common the column name is "sentence" and on fleurs "transcription"

### farsipal — 12/06/2022 6:17 PM
What code are you using? I haven't looked at the new  dataset interleaving script that @sanchit-gandhi  put on the repo but I assume it handles these incompatibilities among different datasets.  Here is his explanation:

### Transformer — 12/07/2022 1:10 AM
yes I used this script but it seems that has a bug
### sanchit-gandhi — 12/07/2022 7:10 AM
Hey @Transformer! There's no bug in the script 😉 You just need to install datasets from main:

pip uninstall datasets
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets


There's a note in the notebook about this:
Image
The method remove_columns was broken in Datasets. A patch was merged last week. We need to install datasets from main to get these changes!
### sanchit-gandhi — 12/07/2022 7:12 AM
I've written a function that let's you do this! See the notebook https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/blob/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event/fine-tune-whisper-streaming.ipynb:

def load_streaming_dataset(...):
    ...

load_streaming_dataset("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0", "es", split="train+validation", use_auth_token=True)

 
Let me know if you have any other questions / issues! Happy to help!
### sanchit-gandhi — 12/07/2022 7:14 AM
Interesting! They're similar sized training sets, so makes sense that the eval WER performance is similar. Let's try combining them!
### sanchit-gandhi — 12/07/2022 7:15 AM
Is this with the medium checkpoint evaluated on Greek CV11?
### Transformer — 12/07/2022 7:19 AM
@sanchit-gandhi  I got this error when trying to combine them for the greek language
I run it again with the new installation of datasets and it is ok now. Thank you

I used your notebook https://huggingface.co/farsipal/whisper-small-el/blob/main/fine-tune-whisper-streaming-cf11-el-v2.ipynb
after I wrote to you, I decided to compare your notebook and the original.

### sanchit-gandhi — 12/08/2022 5:51 AM
Hey @Aigiz! 

    model.config.forced_decoder_ids = None

This is correct! The forced_decoder_ids specify certain tokens that are 'forced' at the beginning of the generation process. The probabilities of these tokens are set to 1 in the decoding process. We use the 'forced' ids for inference with the pre-trained model to control the language and the task (transcribe or translate). 

For fine-tuning, we don't need to set any forced ids -> we train the model to predict the correct language and task tokens, so the fine-tuned model knows the correct language and task ids to set by itself 🙂 

Hope that makes sense!
### Transformer — Today at 7:51 AM
@MilesT did you manage to use both common voice and fleurs for fine tuning? My training stops at step 1000 with this error even though I have converted the sampling rate to 16000
Image

### MilesT — Today at 8:27 AM
I got the same problem on script, but on notebook it's ok. 
I guess we 're missing something 😊
@farsipal if I remember correctly you got a .py that works for interleaving?
### farsipal — Today at 10:45 AM
I have the script modified so that it does both dataset interleaving and runs non-streaming (for smaller sets like el). 
[Here it is.](https://github.com/kamfonas/whisper-fine-tuning-event/blob/minor-mods-by-farsipal/run_speech_recognition_seq2seq_streaming.py)

# Sanch Gandhi Suggestions 
### sanchit-gandhi — Today at 10:55 AM
Thanks for sharing your results @farsipal! I'll summarise them briefly here:

1) No fine-tuning: 31% WER (this is from Whisper paper on CV9, would be similar for CV11)
2) Fine-tune and freeze encoder: 25% WER
3) Fine-tune full model: 20% WER

I think this highlights what you get by training the encoder vs freezing it: the acoustic side of the model is able to better adapt to your source audio when you train it 
Personally I've only tried freezing the encoder with the medium model and on English. Here, I made the following observations:
1. The model converges faster when you freeze the encoder vs not (if you're training for a small number of steps, better to freeze)
2. If you train for long enough, not freezing the encoder almost always wins (if you're training for more steps, better not to freeze)
3. Freezing the encoder gets you much bigger batch sizes and a bit faster training
But I think with multilingual you'll get a lot of benefit from training the encoder, especially with smaller models. Here, model capacity plays a big role. For the small model, we don't have many model parameters, but lots of languages we need to learn. By fine-tuning the encoder, we can train the model to 'forget' some of the languages it doesn't need to know, and improve on the language we care about! 
With Hindi, I couldn't get it to work really freezing the encoder, the performance was nowhere near as good as training the full model. For Greek, it looks like freezing the encoder gets you halfway there, but really you need to fine-tune the full model
Also I think there's an inefficiency currently with our training script: when we disable gradients for the encoder, we still use gradient checkpointing. Gradient checkpointing slows down the forward pass at the expense of more memory efficient gradient computations, but since we don't need these gradients we can turn off checkpointing for the encoder! So we can anticipate a little bit more speed up when freezing the encoder in the optimised script
farsipal — Today at 11:04 AM
I agree. Although I didn't measure the clock time the duration was significantly less than half the unfrozen run.
Is there a way to, say... only freeze the lower half of the encoder layers via the api in place?
Are we restricted to using gradient checkpointing? Can we try forward and cache? 
sanchit-gandhi — Today at 11:19 AM
the duration was significantly less than half the unfrozen run
Okay that's pretty significant! We can speed this up even more by fixing the gradient checkpointing inefficiency!

only freeze the lower half of the encoder layers via the api in place?
Going into that level of detail will require you to change the modelling code in Transformers. You want to change this line: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/bf9a5882a7125a6050aaad0f52257f07df062d6a/src/transformers/models/whisper/modeling_whisper.py#L680
It needs to be:
if self.gradient_checkpointing and self.training and idx < NUM_LAYERS_TO_FREEZE:

where we set the variable NUM_LAYERS_TO_FREEZE as the number of encoder layers to freeze

Are you comfortable making changes to Transformers that are reflected in your environment? I can walk you through how to do this if not!

Are we restricted to using gradient checkpointing? Can we try forward and cache?
Not at all! We use gradient checkpointing because it facilitates much larger batch sizes. You can disable it in the training_args (gradient_checkpointing=False). Then just make sure that you also set model.config.use_cache=True before we instantiate the Trainer. You'll likely need to lower your per_device_train_batch_size by doing this. 
farsipal — Today at 11:42 AM
I am trying to use the python script. I found the sequencing to be a bit different and I was not sure if I needed to change anything regarding the pipe.model.config.forced_decoder_ids = pipe.tokenizer.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language=model_args.config_name, task=data_args.task)  (not sure if I got the arguments right)
farsipal — Today at 11:45 AM
I would appreciate any help I can get on modifying transformer code. I have looked into this before when trying to add a rank-based metric for quetsion-answering with squad but was not brave enough to do it yet 
Drishti — Today at 12:03 PM
Noted. Thanks for the clarification..
sanchit-gandhi — Today at 12:38 PM
Okay here's a rapid guide for setting it up! What we're going to do is:
1. Uninstall transformers from pip
2. Clone transformers from GitHub
3. cd into the transformers repo
4. Add upstream transformers so we can git pull
5. Install transformers from source (pip install transformers -e .)

pip uninstall transformers
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
pip install transformers -e .
 
Now you can view the modelling file:
vim ~/transformers/models/whisper/modeling_whisper.py

Making changes here will be reflected in your environment

farsipal — Dec 6 2022 at 5:53 PM

I am trying to run the small model using the latest python script for another frozen encoder run for translation from greek (el), but I think there are some things we can improve:

There is an error caused by the deprecated call (around liine 420) to model.freeze_feature_encoder() which I commented out.

There is no parameter to control caching, which seems to default to True, and it clashes with the gradient checkpointing (which is implicit for this model). At every step, it logs a warning about the incompatibility and that it changed use_cache to False. As a matter of fact, I don't see a way to change gradient checkpointing either  (at least from the args). We should be able to have an argument to enable/disable gradient_checkpointing and depending on it invoke enable/disable_gradient_checkpointing() on the model. Another option that would be nice to have is whether to stream or not. 

Maybe these parameters exist somewhere and I don't see them in the documentation or the code. So I only added the model_args.use_cache to avoid the delay caused by the warnings and will wait till tomorrow to add the enable_gradient_checkpointing and the streaming option. 

The run started around 5:30PM EST. I will let it run overnight and use a physical connection to avoid the wifi suspension when going to sleep.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sanchit-gandhi — Dec 7 2022 at 6:50 AM

Here is your suggestion:

if self.gradient_checkpointing and self.training and idx < NUM_LAYERS_TO_FREEZE:

Sorry ignore this suggestion! I read through and misinterpreted what we were trying to achieve. There's no need to change this line - it won't change the freezing, only the gradient checkpointing. So we can leave it as is

What you're doing is correct - we want to incrementally freeze the encoder layers. You can test this, but it will look something like this (L610):
```
def _freeze_parameters(self):
    # freeze the conv 
    for param in self.conv1.parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False
    for param in self.conv2.parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False
    for param in self.embed_positions.parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False

    # freeze the first encoder layers
    for layer_idx in range(NUM_LAYERS_TO_FREEZE):
        for param in self.layers[layer_idx].parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False
```
This will freeze the first NUM_LAYERS_TO_FREEZE layers of the encoder
You can adapt this script for interleaving CV11 and FLEURS: https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/blob/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event/interleave_streaming_datasets.ipynb
You simply need to swap the dataset language code from "es" to "el", and remove the VoxPopuli and MultiLingual LibriSpeech parts:

```
dataset_names = ["mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0", "google/fleurs"]
dataset_config_names = ["es", "el_gr"]
text_column_names = ["sentence", "transcription"]
```

There is an error caused by the deprecated call (around liine 420) to model.freeze_feature_encoder() which I commented out.

We set this to "False" in our training arguments. 

sanchit-gandhi — Today at 7:04 AM
See the section in the README for using the Python script! https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event#python-script

It's got some helpful tips and start-to-finish instructions for how you can use these resources 🤗

Essentially, what you want to do is create a file called run.sh that has all the arguments that we pass to the training script. You can see an example of creating this file run.sh in the README. It has all the arguments that control our dataset, language, checkpoint and training args like gradient checkpointing, batch size, gradient accumulation steps, etc

There is an error caused by the deprecated call (around liine 420) to model.freeze_feature_encoder() which I commented out.
We set this to "False" in our training arguments, see the README:
--freeze_feature_encoder="False" \

it logs a warning about the incompatibility and that it changed use_cache to False
Will push a PR to fix this today, essentially when we load the config we can do:
```
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
    model_args.config_name if model_args.config_name else model_args.model_name_or_path,
    cache_dir=model_args.cache_dir,
    revision=model_args.model_revision,
    use_auth_token=True if model_args.use_auth_token else None,
    use_cache=False if training_args.gradient_checkpointing else True,
)
 ```
I don't see a way to change gradient checkpointing either  (at least from the args)
Gradient checkpointing is set by the arg --gradient_checkpointing. We set it to True in the example on the README. If you want to disable it, set the following in your training arguments file run.sh 
```
--gradient_checkpointing="False" \
```
(see README and docs on Seq2SeqTrainingArguments: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments.gradient_checkpointing)

We should be able to have an argument to enable/disable gradient_checkpointing
We have this! See above 🙂

Another option that would be nice to have is whether to stream or not. 

Very true! It would be nice to have a script where we can enable / disable streaming mode. Unfortunately, the two modes require slightly different loading logic, so we can't have them under one script for now. I'll add a script for non-streaming mode shortly: it will use exactly the same arguments as the streaming mode one, so you can swap them out 1-for-1. This is a good idea for the future though!
I hope that answers your questions @farsipal! In summary, you can control the training args with your file run.sh, including things like gradient checkpointing etc 🙂 Check out the README for more detailed instructions! https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event#python-script Best of luck with your training runs! Keep us posted with any results!

# @jilp Scripts for Setup on cloud
jilp — Yesterday at 4:44 PM
Hi, I created scripts for speeding up the environment setup for Lambda cloud instances. Here's how to use them:

1. Initialize the Lambda instance and launch the Cloud IDE.

2. In Jupyter Lab, click on "Upload Files" and upload the two scripts install_ffmpeg_env.py and install_venv_env.py.

3. SSH into the GPU from your local machine and run this command from your local device: python install_ffmpeg_env.py.

4. You'll know the first script is finished when your virtual environment name is at the start of your command line.

5. Run this command python install_venv_env.py and your environment will be ready.

I hope they save you time and effort!

# Learning Rate Discussion

ierre — 12/07/2022 7:05 AM
@sanchit-gandhi Hi. In the github whisper page event, the learning rate is 1e-5. However, I do not see this value in the Whisper OpenAI paper (see page 28 and screen-shot). What is your proposal for each Whisper model (tiny, base, small, medium, large, large v2)? Thank you. (note: I understand that the LR for fine tuning is lower than the LR for pre-training but since the LR value is really important to get good results, I prefer to ask)

Hey @pierre! Great question! The learning rate is indeed a very important parameter to get good fine-tuning performance, and one that we have to experiment with to get right. My recommendation would be to monitor the training loss for the first 500-1000 training steps of your fine-tuning run to gauge whether you've set the learning rate appropriately. Each case is different, but I've tried to give a setting that works best for most!

In practice, using a lower learning rate for fine-tuning vs pre-training gives superior results. These are the observations that I made when fine-tuning the Whisper model for the ESB paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13352) and from my extensive testing for multilingual fine-tuning prior to the event. Generally, I found that a learning rate of 1e-5 worked well for the small and medium checkpoints across most languages. This is the highest learning rate that you can get away with without the gradient updates becoming noisy. Selecting a higher learning rate means that you perform larger parameter updates, and so should be able to push the parameters into a more optimal range faster. But if you go too high, you risk the gradient updates becoming unstable, giving a noisy training loss curve and noisy parameter updates. This is when you'll get worse performance.

A good training loss curve looks similar to the one from @farsipal from the Greek fine-tuning run (https://huggingface.co/farsipal/whisper-small-el). Look how it smoothly decays. This is exactly what we want from a loss curve

Now a noisy training loss curve looks similar to the one from @KLyN fine-tuning on Korean (I hope you don't mind me sharing so that we can all learn from this run!):

We can see that the training loss for the first 1k train steps jumps around a lot, doesn't decay gradually, and gets stuck around a value of 0.5. These are signs that are training loss is too high. With @KLyN, we've reduced the learning rate to 3e-7 and are getting much smoother loss curves 🙌
I asked the Whisper author Jong Wook Kim (who spoke on Monday) about his suggestions for fine-tuning. His recommendation was to select a learning rate about 40x smaller than pre-training, and linearly decay it to 0 over the course of training. For the small checkpoint, this would be 5e-4 / 40 = 1.25e-5, near enough 1e-5! So my empirical observations align with his 🙂

You can use this as a rule of thumb for selecting the learning rate!

Thanks @sanchit-gandhi for your detailed answer.
